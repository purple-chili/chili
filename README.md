# Chili: for data analysis and engineering.

## Language syntaxes

[Chili](https://purple-chili.github.io/) uses [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) for data manipulation and [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)/[Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) for data storage. It provides two language syntaxes:

- chili: a modern programming language similar to `javascript`.
- pepper: a vintage programming language similar to `q`.

## Vim syntaxes

Copy all files in `vim-config` directory to `~/.vim` directory.

`cp -r vim-config/* ~/.vim/`
