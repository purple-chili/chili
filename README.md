# Chili: for data analysis and engineering.

## Language syntaxes

[Chili](https://purple-chili.github.io/) uses [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) for data manipulation and [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)/[Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) for data storage. It provides two language syntaxes:

- chili: a modern programming language similar to `javascript`.
- pepper: a vintage programming language similar to `q`.
